# Your Easy Start into Programming Projects in R & KNIME   

Dear NIMSies,
here you'll find all the necessary information from the past skill-sharing workshop:

1) Slides as PDF
2) Zoom-Recording from 8pm onwards
3) The code we presented to you in the live session:

* 3a Google Trends (R script)
* 3b Reddit Webscraper (Python & R Script)

If you want to work with the Reddit project, drop me a DM via Slack. Then I'll share the data with you!
